# Break / Continue / Pass

- When working with Loops, there are 2 other things we can use besides "break", that is "continue", and "pass"

##### Break
- It will read the line for "break" and break out of the Loop at that line

##### Continue
- Once the Loop reads the line for "continue" it will go back to the beginning of the Loop
- Hence, ignoring all lines of code after the "continue", even if they are indented and belong to the block of code of the Loop

##### Pass
- This one does not do anything useful
- This will only act as a "placeholder" while you are coding
