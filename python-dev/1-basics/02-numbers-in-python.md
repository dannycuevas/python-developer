# NUMBERS IN PYTHON

- We will begin with 2 numerical data types
```
-int = integer (a whole number)
-float = floating point number (a decimal number)
```

- FYI, we would need more memory to store a "floating" number, than an "integer" number (whole number)

- Float numbers will stay as floating numbers even the math is equal to a whole number
- Example:
```python
>>> print(9.9 + 1.1)
11.0
```

##### Why doesn't 0.1+0.2-0.3 equal 0.0 ?
- This has to do with floating point accuracy and computer's abilities to represent numbers in memory. For a full breakdown, check out:
