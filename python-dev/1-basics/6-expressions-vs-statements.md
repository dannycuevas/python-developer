# What is an Expression

- Lets take for example first the code below
```python
iq = 100
user_age = iq / 5
```
- **The expression is the `iq / 5` as it is "a piece of code that produces a Value"**
	- In this case, it means 100 divided by 5 is equal to 20


# What is an Statement

- The Statement in the other hand, is the entire line of code that performs some sort of action
- From the code example above, this would be the Statement
```python
user_age = iq / 5
```
- **In this example, what is the Action?**
	- We are calculating 100 divided by 5, and then "assigning that Value to a Variable"
