# NONE

- "None" would be a special Data Type that exists in Python, and most languages will have something like this, to represent "the absence of Value"

```python
>>> armor = none
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    import platform
            ^^^^
NameError: name 'none' is not defined. Did you mean: 'None'?

>>> armor = None
>>> print(armor)
None
```
