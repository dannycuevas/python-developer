# MATH FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON

- Just like there is `print()` function or `type()` function, in Python, there are "math functions" too, such as;
	- "round"
	- "abs"

- Example of `round()` function 
```
>>> print(round(3.1))
3

>>> print(round(3.9))
4
```

- Example of `abs()` function
- `abs()` returns the absolute value of the argument (no negative numbers)
```
>>> print(abs(-20))
20
```

> DEVELOPER NOTE
> - You will have to google "python math functions" so you can learn more about them, but you will get better this way
