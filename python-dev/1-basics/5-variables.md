# Variables in Python

- Variables store information, that we can use in our programs, like "values" for example, or perhaps "user inputs" too

- Once you have named and assigned a value to a variable, you can use it whenever you want in your program
```
>>> iq = 190
>>> print(iq)
190
```

- Here is another quick way of naming variables
```
>>> a,b,c = 1,2,3
>>> print(a)
1
>>> print(b)
2
>>> print(c)
3
```

### Variables Naming Guidelines

- Using `snake_case`
- Start with "lowercase" or the "underscore" `_`
- Letters, then numbers or underscores
- Names are Case Sensitive
- DO NOT overwrite "Python Keywords"
