# SETS

- Our last Data Type and our last Data Structure, at least from the main ones, the "Set"
- **Sets are unordered collections of unique objects, and they use curly brackets like a Dict, but they do not have key-value pairs, Sets just have unique values**

- Simple example of a Set, where we print out the contents of the Set
```python
>>> seto = {1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5}
>>> print(seto)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
- Notice, Sets are collections of "unique values", even when you print them out, you will only get unique values back

- Now we will convert a regular List, into a Set, so we can print out only unique values using the Set, instead of printing everything out like we would with a regular List
```python
>>> nums = [1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5]
>>> print(set(nums))
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

- We cannot search indexes in a Set, but we can check if a item does exist in a Set
```python
>>> seto = {1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5}
>>> print(seto)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

>>> print(seto[2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    import platform
          ^^^^^^^
TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

# -> is number 4 in nums Set ?
>>> print(4 in seto)
True
```
