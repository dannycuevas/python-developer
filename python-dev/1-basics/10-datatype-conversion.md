# DATA TYPES CONVERSION

- Convert one data type into a different source of data type

- For example, convert a number (which would ordinarily be an integer) into a string, so into a text, be using the string `str` function
- And then print out its new data type
```python
>>> print(str(2108))
2108
>>> print(type(str(2108)))
<class 'str'>
```

# Converting the type of Data Types

- Now lets take the code to a different structure, and converting the number 100 into a string, and then back to an integer
- We will then get a Variable to print out the new data type, and finally print out that value
```python
>>> a = str(327)
>>> b = int(a)
>>> c = type(b)
>>> print(c)
<class 'int'>
```
