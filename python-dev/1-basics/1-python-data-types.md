# PYTHON DATA TYPES

- What is a Data Type? It is a "value" in Python, just values
- And a "program" is simply "instructions that tell the computer what to do"
	- meaning, storing information, or a data type, and being able to modify that information
	- so like taking action on the data types

- **These are the fundamental Data Types in Python (they are the "core" to the language):**
```
- int = numbers
- float
- bool
- str = letters
- list
- tuple
- dict
  
- none = means "nothing", like "zero" in math
```

- So we need to learn to work with data, to be able to;
	- manipulate the data,
	- create
	- store
	- read
	- change
	- remove data as well 


# Python Classes

- **Beyond the core data types, we can actually create our own data types; they are called "classes"**
	- They are like "custom types" and you can name them whatever you want 


# Specialized Data Types

- These ones are not built into Python, but they are like "special packages" and "modules" that we can use from "libraries"
- So you can think of these as "extensions" that we can add to the language


# Get the data type

- Print the data type of the code by using `type()`
```python
print(type(2 + 4))

<class 'int'>
```
