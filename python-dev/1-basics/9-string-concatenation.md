# STRING CONCATENATION

- What does "String Concatenation" mean? it simply means adding strings (or texts) together

- Example
```python
>>> print('the sensei' + ' Dani-El')
the sensei Dani-El
```

- While working with strings, make sure that they are all indeed strings

- Example of a string with a integer, and its error
```python
>>> print('the sensei' + 12498)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    import platform
          ^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```
