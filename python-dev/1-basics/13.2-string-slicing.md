# STRING SLICING

- Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a "slice" of the String.
- Slicing has the following syntax, defining 3 parts of the "slice":
```python
[start : stop : step]
```

##### Start
- This will be the numerical index of the slice start

##### Stop
- The index you will go up to - but NOT include

##### Step
- Size of the jump you take from Start to Stop

### Examples

- We will define a Variable and then grab only the first 3 characters
- Remember that index starts at number "0" (zero) - so we are "searching" by up 1 more number
```python
mystring = "abcdefghijk"
mystring[:3]
>>>'abc'
```

```python
mystring[3:6]
>>>'def'
```

- If `s='Sammy'` what is the output of `s[2:]`?
```python
'mmy'
```

- Print the value of the Variable by "jumping by 2"
```python
mystring[::2]
>>>'acegik
```

- Reversing the String
```python
mystring[::-1]
'kjihgfedcba'
```
