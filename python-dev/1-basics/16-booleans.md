# BOOLEANS

- In Python, these are just called `bool` 
- And they can only have 2 values ever;
	- True
	- or False

- Basically, "booleans" in Python, represent this "idea of True or False"

- And so, booleans can help us control the flow of our program
- For example, do something if something is True, and do another different thing if something is False

- Example printing out the actual values of a boolean in Python
```python
>>> print(bool(1))
True
>>> print(bool(0))
False
```
