# Augmented Assignment Operator

- In Python we could do math operations calling the variables, within the same variable, and then executing the math operation
```python
>>> some_value = 5
>>> some_value = some_value + 2
>>> print(some_value)
7
```

- But there is something called "augmented assignment operator" which will allow us to do the same operations without all the extra typing, and making it look more elegant
```python
>>> some_value = 5
>>> some_value += 2
>>> print(some_value)
7
```

- So, at the end, the "operator" comes to the left of the equal sign
- Remember, that for this work, we first need to have the Variable created and give it some Value
