# Python Development

## My Learning Python Journey - by Daniel Cuevas

-This project started in January 2024, with the goal of keeping track of my Python learning process, and to document everything as I progress over time.

-My desire was to, at some point in the future, be able to look back and contemplate my beginnings, my ups and downs, and write a book with in my own words that could possibly allow me to re-learn Python as many times as I need throughout my life.

-Or maybe even be able to help others learn too. Ultimately, we are on this planet to learn and teach each other.
