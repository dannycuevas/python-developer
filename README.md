# Python Development

## My Python Journey - by Daniel Cuevas

-This project originally started in January 2024, with the goal of keeping track of my Python learning process, and to document everything as I progress over time.
-Unfortunately, I was only able to run it for a surprisingly whole month XD, and have just retaken it in September 2025, but with the promise of keeping it real 100% (:

-My desire was to, at some point in the future, be able to look back and contemplate my beginnings, my ups and downs, and write a book in my own words that could possibly allow me to re-learn Python as many times as I need throughout my life.

-Or maybe even be able to help others learn too. Ultimately, we are on this planet to learn and teach each other. And I would really love this repository to become some sort of Python bible in some capacity... never say never lol.
