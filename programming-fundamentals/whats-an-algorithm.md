- An Algorithm is a series of steps taken to solve a specific problem
- **An Algorithm is a precise sequence of steps and instructions to solve a given problem in any programming language** 
	- so, it just focus on the high-level idea of how to solve a problem


- Pseudocode is a high-level description of a computer program or algorithm that uses human-readable language to express the logic and steps of the program 


- It describes how we can go and
	- get a sequence of random numbers
	- search through them
	- and find the minimum
- So, what it will do is, finding the minimum number from a list of numbers provided by the user
	- so it will iterate over the list, number by number
	- at the end, once we have scanned the entire list of numbers we can be confident we have found the minimum number 
- And this is "express in a diagram form"
