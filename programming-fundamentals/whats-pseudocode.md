- You can not "only express an Algorithm" using a diagram, you can also do it with pseudocode, using "text" case format, to "express the Algorithm in a sequence of steps"
- This will use "informal language" at this point, so humans can actually read it an understand it, oppose to use a programming language

- **Pseudocode is a high-level description of a computer program or algorithm that uses human-readable language to express the logic and steps of the program**
