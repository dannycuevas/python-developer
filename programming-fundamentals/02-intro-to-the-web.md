- Remember "The Internet" is The Network of networks infrastructure that enables many many things, including the "world wide web"

# The Web

- The World Wide Web, commonly known as The Web
- It is an **"Information System" where we are able to share documents and resources** over the internet
- Those resources / **documents are identified by "URLs" (uniform resource locators)** 

- And the way that the information is transferred, and the way that the web really works, is that **there is this protocol "HTTP" (hypertext transfer protocol)**
- This is the foundation of how the world wide web works, how we communicate, and how we request and share resources or web pages
- HTTP is a protocol, is a "Standardized sort of set of rules" for how a form of communication should work

### How do you find the right Web pages?

- Lets say you want to go to `google.com`

- So when you go to a web page, you are generating a "Request", a request to the URL you are trying to visit
- And there is a long journey that your Request undergoes before it actually makes it to the web page hosting server
- But all in all, this "is a request asking for this particular resource"
- And at some point hopefully we get a response back from the web hosting server back to our machine saying "here you go, this is what you asked for"
- Then, the browser's job is to display the information for us in a beautiful webpage
